# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project


## *Things that I would want to add to the project*

- **Pictured Menu**  I would like to have a sliding menu for Filter, Espresso and Baked Goods. It would look creative if for each theme the customer could slide the picture to see the next item.
- **A separated page for booking a table**  Instead of booking a table on the main block page I would want the user to press a button where it takes him to separate page for bookings.
- **Sticky Menu**  A sticky menu would help a user to press to the navigation buttons at anytime to go to the specific part of the website. 
- **About page** It feels that the about page is not interesting and its text does not really fit. Instead i would use some interactive icons with some text to it. The icons would get user's attention and he would be more likely to see the information.

## '''Overall i enjoyed completing this project.''' It was a challenge to code this web page but at the same time this made you  keep going to solve all issues that was encountered.
